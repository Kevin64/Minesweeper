An implementation of Minesweeper using SDL for rendering, input and audio. The 2.0 release of the game offers to the player the possibility of choosing fields up to 30 columns and 15 rows.

All graphic assets were made by me, with the exception of the EXE/Window icon and the rotating mines of the main menu. Those were downloaded from www.subpng.com and the credits go to Sxohheevl. (https://www.subpng.com/png-o0p16v/)
